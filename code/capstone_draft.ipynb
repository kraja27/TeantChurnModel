    "Tenant Churn or Tenant turnover is one of the challenges if you are managing multiple properties with diversified tenants. Modeling tenant churn is a classical application of data science.Â To put in a simple language a churn model is a binary classification model that given a set of predictors, or input variables, outputs a classification. Our churn model will predict, if a tenant rents a unit, the probability that tenant will leave within a given time frame, for example 1 year. Armed with this knowledge a property manager can better understand how the tenant mix will change over time and which units are likely to become available soon. This will enable managers to proactively target the high churn candidates and provide incentives for them to extend their contract. In addition, the model can highlight which units likely will need to be filled in the future, so that the vacancy period of a unit can be reduced."

    "To address the challenge of finding the correct reddit post, our first strategy is to finalize a good reddit source for comparing the two popular sports Soccer and Cricekt. While most of us think Soccer as the most popular sports, data told us a different story. Cricket is played around 50 countries with 2.5 billion fans while football is played in over 200 countries with 3.5 billion fans. In other words per country there are 50 million cricket fans compared to 17.5 million football fans. It was a challenge to get a correct key word for the amount of data that we needed. We started with specific clubs of these sports and generalized to get enough data. \n",
    "\n",
    "Another challenge we were having was getting enough data (our target was close to 2000 records in each subreddit). I had to change the day window to attain this objective. Once I adjusted the day window to 15 and appropriate fequency I was able to collect enough data for training our models.\n",
    "\n",
    "After extracting the blog post data next decision we had to make was what column or columns needs to be my X. We were inclined to use 'Title' and 'Self text' consdering the relevance of the contents. But after reviewing the shape of data and Null values we have decided to use only 'Title' as 'Self Text' was not adding much value in training my model.  \n",
    "\n",
    "EDA helped me set up a preprocessing plan for our model. For preprocessing, I had created a fucntion that used regex, lemmatizatizer which removed punctuation and stopwords. For modeling, I used  TFIDF and Count vetorizers. They brought context of word choices into play, which will give us a better understanding of the group of words used in a reddit blog post about the sports we are analyzing.\n",
    " \n",
    "Machines had no problem understanding the blog posts, after using vectorizers."
